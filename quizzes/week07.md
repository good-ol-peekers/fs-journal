slots are SIMILAR to components... like a component you can interject into your webpage where-ever and its reusable..  but its also different.. like lets say you wanted to reuse a model for different things you could add a slot into it... so you would essentially have the same model. but the slot in the model being different would actually display different things inside of it depending on how it was interacted with.
