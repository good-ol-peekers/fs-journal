## Questions

1. What is a Pseudo-Class and what are some of the most common ones you think you will use

2. What is Specificity and how might you use it to your benefit?

its like a hierarchy system where if there is a discrepancy between commands given for a "task" the higher specificity will over-rule.
it's a great tool to use. because you can apply for instance lets say a special font to everything with a low specificity, and lets say in just one area of your website you want a fancier, or different font you can change it in just that area by using a higher value of specificity.

3. What problems do you think you could run into if you over-utilized the !important feature?

its so obvious if you answered.the previous question. LoL.
you may want to generalize a "task" out over the whole page, and you may not be able to do it to an area if that area has the !important feature on it.
