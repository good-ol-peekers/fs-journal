## Questions

1. What is your favorite tip that you think is the most beneficial to improving your design?

-for design specifically it would have to be the container, row, column tools for layout. its definitely a toss up between the overall framework of the page, and just custom CSS styling you can create on your own ex: glass cards w/ cool shadows ya know.(w)

2. Compile a couple resources that you think might be helpful when trying to review examples of good design ideas.

bootstrap docs, like they have decent references for items like buttons, cards etc (definitely better style then i had on day 1 LOL), and https://www.rallysportdirect.com/part/2025054-forced-performance-blue-turbocharger-ewg?gclid=EAIaIQobChMIoe7DmavY-QIVuD6tBh17dwDZEAQYASABEgKXPPD_BwE

3. How do you think good design influences people when visiting a website and what sorts of things could you convey through design alone?

ideally the person flows through the website finding exactly what they are looking for which is all guided by design in such a way that the user does it effortlessly.
