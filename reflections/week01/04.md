## Questions

1. What is the purpose of wire-framing? 

to layout a page quickly, make changes to design/layout quickly
to have a "blue print" for coding so you're not time-sinking into code you have to change. 

2. What are the different levels of detail in wire-frames and why is each one useful?

low, medium, high.
each one can be a stepping stone into the next one. "gotta start building a site somewhere right"?
low also has low time/energy invested and easiest to change,
where high is going to be more time/energy/money invested but lets say you have someone who is just a designer at not much of a coder, and you have a coder who can make the design into a live website then that is another great reason to code-out to that spec, or maybe you build a high level wire-frame, the client agrees fully on all the site, well great, now just need it written translated from a wire-frame into something like vscode. no big deal. 

3. Do you think wire-frames are worth the Time, Energy, and Effort that they require? Why or Why not?

at this point in school I totally believe they are worth time, energy, and effort.
just an example i see in the future of being in a career as a developer is you have a client who wants a product, and with low TMR (time, money, resources)
you can build out a website to present to them, and if they have changes for you to make you can do so with alot less effort then if you were writing it all out in code.

Identify at least 1 takeaway from today's assignment

coding along side somebody you can definitely learn a-lot hands on. felt like a mini tutor session. got a few new shortcuts, and work goes alot faster with two people problem solving when you're stuck on something simple lol. its cool. (understanding you wont always have somebody else right there to help though.)

gained some decent understanding with bootstrap, but would like to spend some more time on media query stuff. not nessicarilly in class learning, but in the lab. kinda spaced it. and just built out a website in the larger screen size :/
