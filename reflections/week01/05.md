# Weekly Reflection
This reflection is an open format, so it can be whatever you like. Take this opportunity to write a bit on some of the things you have learned this week, or some of the things that you are still struggling with, identify some challenges you had at the beginning of the week that you were able to overcome, or just generally how you are feeling at this point in the course.

## Prompts
- What went well this week?
- What did you learn as a shock or suprise?
- What are you struggling with?
- What would you count as a victory?


first of all, id say that i enjoyed my time spent in class, and the time i spent writing code, and figuring out what is working.
the thing that surprised me the most is there is the bootstrap column system. biggest struggle is ill completely space a few minutes of lecture, then ask a question on something that was literally just said, and its funny to everyone else. but not a big deal at all.my victory this week is finding balance between school, and my domestic duties, and accomplishing all the tasks that were ahead of me this week, and "being in motion" like having something new and exciting going on, and being in the mix of all of it, not just floating through life wishing i was doing something cool.
