## Questions

1. What is Scope ?

Scope is where information can be accessed. like a variable setup outside a function could be accessed anywhere on the page.

2. What is Hoisting ?

the way javascript reads code is where function declaration moves to the top of their scope before execution

3. In what cases might you use let vs const vs var?

var is globally scoped, while let and const are block scoped
let can be declared without being initialized
use let if you need to update, but not redeclare the value.
so like let tom = thomas
