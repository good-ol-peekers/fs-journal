## Questions

1. What are the three ways to syntactically write a function? What are the differences in how the function acts (if any)?

function thisIsAName(){
    gives a name to the function
}
let banana = function(){
    this function cannot be used until banana(the variable) is defined, and by used i mean evoked
}
let banana ( ) => {
this is a shorter syntax for creating function expression as above, but doesn't generate its on "this" value
}
2. What is the difference between Parameters and Arguments?

parameters are used when defining a function, they are the "names" created in the function definition.

arguments are the values the function receives from each parameter when the function is executed

3. What are higher order functions? Can you provide an example?

when a function accepts another function as a parameter, or returns a function it is called a higher order function. array.prototype.filter &
array.prototype.map
