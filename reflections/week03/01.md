## Questions

1. What problem does using exports solve?
 
 keeps things private, and organized.


2. How does export differ from export default?

export is a function that sends the module from one file to another.
export default is pulling a module with import, without first exporting it???



3. What is a benefit of using the Module System?

tons of benefits, organization..
privacy / sercuity (on some levels im sure it may not be? idk?)
helps with naming conflicts. debugging is easier.
a code referencing a module understands it is a dependency. if the module file is changed or moved, the problem is immediately obvious.

learning how to navigate from one folder to another folder and link information 
to and from folders is difficult (hopefully just at first lol...)
