## Questions

1. What is the purpose of Encapsulation?
you can essentially hide the method from the user increasing security on data,
or to store data in a bundle, to keep it away from other data.

2. What were some of the problems with closures and the underscore prefix?
its not a 100% standard pratice, it is more affluent with the experienced developers. so somebody who may not know 
that it is inteded to note that the function with the _before it implies its not a public / user friendly tool to use...
and so the not experienced coder may actually change it to be a public function causing a security issue.

3. How do we create private variables in a ES6 Class? Why would you do this?

class Counter {
    #count = 0
    click () {
        this.#count += 1;
    }
    getCount () {
        return this.#count.toLocaleString()
    }
}
 using the () inside the class will do. or for true privacy using closure-based Encapsulation.

 both of the above options are better then just using an _

Identify at least 1 takeaway from today's assignment
had a tutor session on this lesson. and it went well.
monday i thought i paid so much attention in class, and took notes,
but today went alot better. still feeling challenged with syntax and getting the folders to talk to eachother with
all the new stuff like.... I understand importing files at the top of the pages, so i understand how to "link" 
together pages from html app, controller, service, appstate then model..(and can troubleshoot the 404 if the .JS is missing) but
im having a hard time understanding when to drill into the folders inside of a function... like appstate.this?
so its more of the context inside of functions im getting lost somewhere in there in class..

lost my repo. will try to come back and update. with a redo on it. i did make some solid progress. was starting to draw information to the screen.
and i did do it. i even had a tutor session on it. which  helpful.
