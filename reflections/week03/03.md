## Questions

1. What are the two common operations that we will set in the handler?
get, set


2. What do you have to make sure you are doing with every Get to ensure the value does not become `undefined`?
the get operator returns to values.
so return the value stored in the key..
so to access the information stored in the key you must provide the inital object, and the key itself, thus returning the value of the key.


3. What are some of the benefits of the proxy object that we are using in our structure for applications?
when you use New Proxy() it will return the value in the inital Object, and the value stored in the key.

so lets say the opposite thing happens.. in a specific instance such as, a hacker is trying to access the value stored in the key., but he doesn't provide 'the correct id (the trap we setup)' then the hacker will not get past our get: function. and be denied access to our value stored in the objects key.

Identify at least 1 takeaway from today's assignment
