data binding, causing by elements clashing.

2. What are the three mechanisms of the observer pattern?
 firstly initilize the event observer, secondly unsubscribe, third is broadcast. and in order to do this..




3. Review the code generated from the bcw-template and reflect on the proxy objects from yesterday, and your understanding of the observer pattern today. With this knowledge, explain how the magic of the bcw-template uses these two concepts to manage and update the dom.
i understand fairly well how both of these ideas work. but im not sure what the BCW template is? are you talking about the BCW.blob.core windows? link atop the page?
or how are these methods comparable to MVCS structure system??
sorry. its not that i dont understand the question. i dont know what the reference is too..

Identify at least 1 takeaway from today's assignment
check your 's' in your controllers name lol..(group was stumped on this one for a minute in lab), 
but its a good point and takeaway from today. naming conventions,
and so is making sure all your ID's and onclicks match,
as-well as when you start doing imports atop the screen, and anywhere else.
