# Weekly Reflection
This reflection is an open format, so it can be whatever you like. Take this opportunity to write a bit on some of the things you have learned this week, or some of the things that you are still struggling with, identify some challenges you had at the beginning of the week that you were able to overcome, or just generally how you are feeling at this point in the course.

## Prompts
- What went well this week?
- What did you learn as a shock or suprise?
- What are you struggling with?
- What would you count as a victory?

punctuality. showing up with a good attitude. doing my best. taking alot of notes. learning as much as i can.. people were nice. 

id say the biggest suprise was MVC layout/encapsulation 

im struggling with javascript. more specifically thinking of the entire path. like after so long i forget what im doing in it.. like i have a hard time staying focused on it. ill start writing out how im going to get a return from my model with some string interpolation. then ill start to hard code in my HTML, then get it to my controller, then pass it on. and i forget how to complete the path. so ill reference and see how people do it. idk maybe instead of trying to code at the same time i should just follow the whole path on some reference while taking notes, then write down how im going to do it. idk. its been a struggle.

im trying.
