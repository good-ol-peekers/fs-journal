## Questions

1. What is the purpose of a Query String?

it gives the clients interface a portion to lets say bring an item up by an ID if its supported in the API.


2. What is the format of a query parameter? How does it start? How do you distinguish between one parameter and the next?

it starts after the ?   
and if there are multiple query parameters they are separated by the & symbol.


3. When do you think Query parameters would be helpful when writing your server?

well lets say you had a title in each object.
and your API was a database.
it would be helpful for the clients interface to include an option to find that particular "subject" or specific "instance" of that object by lets say it could be multiple things. not just a title, but ID etc.

Identify at least 1 takeaway from today's assignment

wasn't feeling to hot on monday. with that being said.. i did take notes and learn a whole lot. biggest thing i learned from monday is how to build out my own API.. obviously not how to do every single part. but the foundation building blocks on how to build my own API.
