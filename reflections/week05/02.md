## Questions

1. What are the three types of relationships?


one to one, one to many, and many to many

2. What are the benefits of the traditional `linking` of relationships instead of `Embedding`


(like if you embedded the comments in the OG blog post example)
linking will not reach the max document size of 16gb
also there isnt a way to limit how many are retrieved
you would have to pull the whole blog post document..

linking using a key is beneficial 
you can return a page of comments saving space.
also a downside is if you have to retrieve 1000 pages of comments could take time



3. What are some of the challenges faced when deciding how to manage a many-to-many relationship that ultimately drive your decision on how to create it?

the keys that link them together.
how to query in this instance.
