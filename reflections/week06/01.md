## Questions

1. What is Component based architecture?

its a similar to MVC in one way. where it is a encapsulation style folder system. 
but its different in the fact where each component has its own MVC essentially. but maybe a little bit different layout of folders. for instance each component would have its own controller, services, axios, etc. and could be pasted onto the web at will.


2. What are some benefits of Component based architecture?

each component can update the server individually without having to update all the other components.
with facebook as an example you can have multiple chats open, each one acting independently.
 



3. What are some drawbacks to Component based architecture?

as compared to MVC structure and layout its readability tends to be affected. MVC has single responsibility per folder. where component while is still encapsulated its very bloated.
