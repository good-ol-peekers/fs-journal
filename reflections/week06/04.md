## Questions

1. What is a nested route?

nested routes are more complex routes allowing more complex interfaces of components inside of other components 


2. When might you use a nested route? (other than the provided example)

lets say you have a project page of all the project. then a creator page that is tied to an accounts id.
well from the front page well call it the project page. lets say you want to click on a button and it takes you to the person that created it. from there you could also get all that persons personal projects on the account page so 
project/creatorId/project


3. Can you pass parameters through nested routes? When might you use them?

yes. params are super helpful to be used also.
you can take a ID in from an API then use it for a param for an example.
