## Reflect on your partner project and answer the following questions

1. Which principles from this weeks reading did you implement?
liskov substitution 



2. What went well this week?
uhm, definitely got alot of coding, and even though i didnt finish the project 100% i still am happy with my personal growth, as compared to beating myself up for being slower then class mates at writing working code.


3. What would you do differently?
i would of spent more time tuesday DURING school to get my website launched && my back end working correctly to start building my back end tuesday night, instead of late starting weds, AND i wouldnt of taken the inital advice to code across from back end to front end. i think i should of super time sinked and zoned into some pattern to knockout the back end before moving to the front end.
